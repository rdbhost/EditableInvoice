Editable Invoice
==================


Another [noBackend](http://nobackend.org/) example app, to showcase how an HTML prototype can be turned into a real
product in a matter of hours.

This example app features the backend service Rdbhost.com.  Rdbhost.com provides a low-level API featuring SQL in the
 browser, safely.

The 'create_invoice_db.html' page contains JavaScript to create the server side tables for invoice storage.
If you fork a copy of this app for your Rdbhost account, change the account number throughout,
and then load the 'create_invoice_db.html' page to create the backend tables.
